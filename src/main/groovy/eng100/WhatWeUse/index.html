    <h4>
        <u>Screw Threads</u>
    </h4>
    <p>
        Let's start with what makes a screw unique in hardware: the threads. The threads from the screw make the screw
        unique because the screw
        is one of the only pieces of hardware that contains threads and anything else that has threads can usually be
        classified as a screw.
        The threads for a screw have two main functions. One of the functions the thread for a screw serves is
        converting rotational motion
        to linear motion. Some examples of this are vehicles that move from screws, fastening, measurement, worm drives,
        and conveying items from one
        place to another. Another function of screw threads is to prevent linear motion in the opposite direction unless
        the screw threads are being
        rotated in the according direction. This is how fastening things with screws works. When a screw turns, it will
        hold the two objects being
        fastened together until the screw is turned in the opposite direction it was fastened with.

    <p>
        Screw threads can be classfied in a variety of ways. One standard that screw threads can be classified under is
        the UTS standard
        (United Thread Standard). UTS standard is most commonly used in the United States and Canada. UTS describes the
        screw thread by puting
        the size of the hole the screw can be inserted into, a colon, then puting how many threads per inch the screw
        has (hole size:threads per inch).
        Another standard that is commonly used in the United States is the ISO metric screw thread standard. This
        standard is used by puting an M,
        the outer diameter in millimeters, a multiplication sign, then how far the screw moves in millimeters by
        rotating the head a full turn
        (Example: M5*1).

    <h4><u>Screw Sizes</u></h4>
    <p>
        Screw sizes have multiple dimensions. Gauge refers to the diameter of the screw and is written simply as a
        number
        starting with 0 being the smallest gauge referring to the smallest diameter. The next measurement is the number
        of threads per inch. The fewer threads per in the faster the screw is driven. The final measurement used is
        simply the length of the screw. Length is measured from where the screw will lay level with the material it is
        driven into to the tip. The standard fromat for the measurement for a screw is Gauge - TPI (Threads per inch)
        X Length. A #8 (8 gauge) screw with 32 threads per inch that is one inch long would be listed as 8-32 X 1". Many
        times the threads per inch measurement is dropped so the aforementioned screw would be 8-32"

        The other common specification for a screw refers to the driver needed to turn the screw. The most common types
        of
        drives are phillips and regular. This is an indented patter at the top of the screw where a tool is inserted to
        turn
        the screw.
    </p>

    <h4><u>Drills</u></h4>
    <p>
        Drills are devices used to bore holes in materials. They use screws inorder to aid in the boring of the hole.
        The thread pattern on the drills brings the material up to the surface. Drills are also very low effort tools
        since most of the force is spent turning the screw rather than forcing it through the material. This is again
        aided by the threads which drive the drill further and further down or through the material as it turns.

    <h4><u>Grades</u></h4>
    <p>
        Grade refers to the strength of the screw. The metric system and inch system have different grade ratings, but
        for both the higher
        the number the greater the strength. The grade rating is stamped on the head or on the box that the screw comes
        in. In the metric system
        the numbers are cla
        ssified with a first number and a single digit decimal number. The first number refers to the ultimate tensile
        strength,
        or the minimum stress the bolt can withstand before breaking. The second number refers to the tensile yield
        strength, or the strength that the
        bolt or screw cannot not recover from. In the Inch system, the numbers fo grade are specified as a single digit.
        The are classified on the SAEJ429 classification system for strength. The numbers range from 0 to 8, with 8
        being the strongest. There are
        no grades above 8 for this classification. The most common used grades are 5 and 8.
